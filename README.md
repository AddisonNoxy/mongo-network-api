# Mongo Network API
This application serves as a demonstration of a functional MongoDB database interaction using Express.

## Installation
Clone the repo to your local machine, and run "npm i" in your console to install necessary dependencies. MongoDB is required for this application as well.

## Usage
Run 'node server.js' in your console to begin the server and connect to the database.

In Insomnia, API routes exist for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests of Users and Thoughts, or posts. Specific thoughts and users can be referenced using their unique ID.

GET and DELETE routes exist for different 'reactions' on the individual thoughts.
